We welcome all contributions.

The core stream of development happens in the in-house VSTS at Eonic Associates LLP. 

So if you don't see any changes for a month or so then don't think nothing is going on, it just that we are working hard behind the scenes.

We do however release our changes to GIThub for every version release.

If you want to contribute our recommendation is as follows

Raise an issue in the issue tracker, allow the team at Eonic a little time to comment and get back to you.

We might allready have a way of doing what you need or be able to suggest a strategy for delivering it that would save you time.

We also might be working on the current area of code and your changes might cause conflicts with the work in progress.

We will then assign the issue to you and await your pull request.

I really will do everything I can to encourge and support community contributions

Kind Regards

Trevor Spink

Lead Solution Archetect.
